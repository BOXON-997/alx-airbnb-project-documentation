Requirements — Airbnb Clone Backend
Overview

This file documents technical & functional requirements for three core backend features:

User Authentication & Authorization

Property Management

Booking System

Each section lists API endpoints, input/output specifications, validation rules, and performance criteria.

1) User Authentication & Authorization
Purpose

Securely allow users to register, log in, and manage sessions. Support roles: guest, host, admin.

Endpoints

POST /api/v1/auth/register

Input: { "name": string, "email": email, "password": string, "role": "guest"|"host" }

Output: 201 Created → { "user": {...}, "accessToken": "jwt", "refreshToken": "..." }

Validation:

email format, unique

password min length 8, complexity (one uppercase, one number) recommended

Security:

Hash password with bcrypt (cost factor 12+)

Rate-limit endpoint

POST /api/v1/auth/login

Input: { "email": email, "password": string }

Output: 200 OK → { "accessToken": "jwt", "refreshToken": "..." }

Validation: check credentials; if failed return 401 Unauthorized (generic message)

POST /api/v1/auth/refresh

Refresh token flow

GET /api/v1/users/:id

Protected; returns public profile or private if owner/admin

Auth Details

JWT claims: sub (user id), role, iat, exp

Short-lived access token (e.g., 15m); refresh token stored securely (DB or signed cookie)

RBAC middleware: enforce per-endpoint checks (hosts can create properties, admins can delete users)

Performance Criteria

Auth endpoints should return within 200-500ms under normal load.

Rate limit: e.g., 10 req/min per IP for register/login.

2) Property Management
Purpose

Enable hosts to create, edit, publish, and delete property listings with images and availability.

Endpoints

POST /api/v1/properties

Role: host

Input (multipart/form-data):

title (string, required)

description (string)

location: { address, city, country, lat, lng }

price_per_night (decimal, required, >= 0)

max_guests (int)

amenities (array of strings)

images[] (files)

Output: 201 Created with created property

GET /api/v1/properties

Query parameters: location, min_price, max_price, amenities, from, to, guests, page, limit

Output: paginated list { items: [...], meta: { page, limit, total } }

PATCH /api/v1/properties/:id

Role: host + owner check

Input: fields to update

Output: 200 OK updated object

DELETE /api/v1/properties/:id

Soft-delete recommended (flag is_active)

Validation Rules

price_per_night must be positive

images: max per listing (e.g., 25), max size per image (e.g., 5MB)

geolocation must be valid coordinates

Storage & Files

Images uploaded to S3 or Cloudinary; store image URLs in DB.

Use signed URLs or CDN.

Performance Criteria

Property listing queries should support indexed searches (GIST index on location for geo queries)

Typical search response with pagination: < 500ms for normal dataset; use Redis caching for repeated queries.

3) Booking System
Purpose

Allow guests to reserve property for specific dates, with proper conflict handling and payment integration.

Endpoints

POST /api/v1/properties/:id/book

Role: guest

Input:

property_id (url param)

start_date (YYYY-MM-DD)

end_date (YYYY-MM-DD)

guests (int)

payment_method (token)

Output:

201 Created booking record { id, property_id, guest_id, start_date, end_date, total_amount, status: "pending" }

Follow-up: 200 OK when payment succeeds and status changes to confirmed

GET /api/v1/bookings/:id

PATCH /api/v1/bookings/:id/cancel

PATCH /api/v1/bookings/:id/confirm (host)

Business & Validation Rules

Date validation:

start_date < end_date

both dates in future (or allow immediate check-in rules)

Availability check:

Prevent overlapping bookings. This must be atomic:

approach A: DB transaction with row-level locks.

approach B: create booking with tentative state and use an availability table with optimistic concurrency.

Payment:

On booking request, either:

charge upfront and confirm booking on successful charge, or

place a hold and capture on confirmation (marketplace decision)

Link reviews to bookings; only allow review if booking status === completed.

Concurrency & Atomicity

Use database transactions for booking creation:

check for overlaps (SELECT FOR UPDATE on availability ranges or use exclusion constraints)

insert booking

create payment intent / process charge

Performance & Scalability

Booking creation should be resilient to concurrent requests for same dates; target < 1s response when not under high load.

Use background worker for post-booking tasks (send emails, schedule payouts).

Additional Notes & Security

Log all payment events, do not store raw card data (use payment provider tokens).

Use HTTPS everywhere.

Encrypt sensitive data at rest where required (e.g., personal identification info).

Implement CSRF protection for stateful endpoints if using cookies.

Input sanitization to prevent SQL injection and XSS.
